* The comutatinal langusistics is the field of trying to understand the human language by understanding the underlaying consepss (science). 
* NLP is about to find patterns in data to make a usefual application using pattern recognition, ML, and DL.
* We made models with reasonalbe accuracy, but we are fare away of understanding how these models acually work, rather than how the human language work.
